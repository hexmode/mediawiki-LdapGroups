== LdapGroups ==

This is MediaWiki extension to allow users to manage their MediaWiki groups using a directory server via LDAP such as Microsoft's ActiveDirectory.

You need to specify a file in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Format ini format] with the authenticaton credentials to use to connect to the directory server with.

<source lang="ini">
[main]
	server = ServerNAme
	user = 'UserName or DN'
	pass = password

	; quotes are required to keep php from getting confused about
        ; the extra equals sign
	basedn = 'Base DN'
</source>

Your mapping of MediaWiki groups to the distinguished names (dn) of the groups on your directory server should be provided in the $LdapGroupsMap variable.  For example:

<source lang="php">
$LdapGroupsMap
    = [ "AWSUsers" =>
        [
            "cn=aws-production,ou=security group,o=top"
        ],
        "NavAndGuidance" =>
        [
            'cn=g001,OU=Groups,o=top',
            'cn=g002,OU=Groups,o=top',
            'cn=g003,OU=Groups,o=top',
        ]
    ];
</source>

Since nested groups are not resolved, multiple DNs have to be specified as above.  Obviously, this is less than ideal.  I plan to add support for [http://ldapwiki.com/wiki/1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN] and allow you to use it by setting $LdapGroupsUseMatchingRuleInChainQueries to true.

I also plan to have a Special Page to set up to allow for group mappings soon.
